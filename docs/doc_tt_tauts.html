    <h2>A Tautomer-Independent Structure Representation</h2>
    <p>
      Tautomers represent a particularly thorny problem in
      cheminformatics.  There are several areas where they are of
      great relevance:
      <ol>
	<li>Getting the protonation and charge states correct for,
	  for example, virtual screening e.g. docking</li>
	<li>When attempting to find a structure in a database,
	  recognising two tautomers of the same molecule as
	  equivalent</li>
	<li>When performing substructure searching, recognising
	  potential tautomers in either the query or target
	  molecule</li>
      </ol>
      None of these are particularly well solved.  The first is
      arguably a physics problem, as the equilibria between the
      various tautomers depends on at least the solvent, the
      temperature and the pH.  In the case of ligand/receptor 
      interactions, it is more than likely that the equilibria are
      different in bulk solvent and in the receptor pocket, which
      further complicates modelling in the field of drug discovery.
      There are various rules-based and physics-based methods for
      estimating the possible tautomers when preparing ligand
      databases for virtual screening.  The second case is essentially
      a chemoinformatics problem.  It suffices merely to recognise all
      the tautomers that might be drawn for a molecule and
      represent them in some predictable way so that a query
      structure can be compared with a second structure and a
      tautomer-independent exact match determined.  The simplest,
      though inefficient, method of doing this is to enumerate all
      possible tautomers of the query and target structure and perform
      some form of graph isomorphism test.  Since there is no need to
      assess the tautomeric equilibria one can tolerate unlikely
      tautomers produced by relatively simple rules-based methods so
      long as false matches are minimised.  The last problem, of
      substructure searching, is the hardest.  Because the possible
      tautomers available to a molecule very much depend on the
      extended environment of functional groups, it is not in general
      possible to describe the tautomers available to an
      isolated substructure.  To perform a tautomer-aware substructure
      query, therefore, one is pretty-much obliged to enumerate all
      tautomers of the target molecules, either on the fly or on
      database creation, and match the substructure against each in
      turn.  This is likely to be expensive in CPU-time and/or
      database size.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work addresses the second of these problems, that of
      finding exact matches of the same molecule in different
      tautomers.  It is intended to be used primarily when adding a
      new molecule to a structural database, to see if it is already
      present.  It might also be used for the associated question of
      whether a compound should be synthesised, or whether it already
      exists in a database and can be obtained from store or
      purchased.  An example of the type of situation that this work is
      attempting to address is shown in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>
      below, for CHEMBL16405 and  CHEMBL417634.

      Clearly these two compounds are tautomers, and even if it is
      possible to isolate them separately it would be helpful if the
      database was able to link them as closely related structures.
      The representation in the 3rd column of the table above shows
      a tautomer-independent representation (the tautomer skeleton) of
      the two molecules, produced by the current work, that shows the
      tautomer system and allows them to be identified as possibly
      being two tautomers of the same compound.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of this work, encapsulated in the program gen_t_skel, is
      to produce a representation of a compound where areas of
      tautomerism are identified, and marked in a <em>tautomer
      skeleton</em> or <em>t_skel</em>.  Before a compound is
      added to a database, as part of the procedure to see if it as a
      duplicate of a compound already present, its t_skel is created
      and compared with  those already in the database.  In the
      program gen_t_skel, the tautomer system is represented by
      setting all bonds to 1 and removing the hydrogen atoms that move
      during the tautomerisation.  The structure so produced is output
      as a canonical SMILES string in which the atoms in the tautomer
      system appear as atoms with unconventional valences. In the
      depiction in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1 above</a>, produced by
      <a href="https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/cpp/depicttk/index.html">OpenEye's
      OEDepict  toolkit</a>, the unusual valence is shown by a 'dot'.
    </p>
    <p>
    The basis of the program gen_t_skel is
    the <a href="10.1002/minf.201400128">paper of Thalheim et al.</a>
    which describes a way of enumerating tautomers. The tautomer
    skeleton is an intermediate step in the enumeration process.
    Program gen_t_skel uses a refined version of their algorithm for
    finding the tautomer skeleton, and a similar method for generating
    tautomers.  Although the tautomers of the compound aren't kept or
    output by gen_t_skel, they are created during the process as
    larger tautomer systems are sometimes only discovered by an
    iterative  process.  For example, in <a href="#figure2">Figure
    2</a>, it is not  immediately obvious that Tautomer 2 is a
    tautomer of Tautomer 1, without inspecting the ketone form,
    Tautomer 3.

    <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
    <h3>Finding the tautomer systems</h3>
    <p>
      Thalheim et al. introduced the concept of hydrogen acceptors and
      donors (HADs) as the key atoms in the tautomerisation process.  To
      convert one tautomer to another, a hydrogen atom is removed from
      a donor atom and added to an acceptor and the bonds adjusted to
      restore valences correctly.  The is clearly a potential
      confusion in this nomenclature with hydrogen <em>bond</em>
      donors and acceptors which are completely different.  Better
      names might have been source and sink or source and destination,
      but I have continued with their convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thalheim et al. define HADs as follows:
      <ol>
	<li id="rule2"> A HAD has a least one double bond to a heavy atom or is
	  connected to an H atom (acceptor and donor respectively)</li>
	<li id="rule3">A HAD without an H atom (acceptor) must have a bond-path
	  to another HAD (donor) than can release an H atom</li>
	<li id="rule4">A carbon atom HAD must not be in an aromatic ring
	  system</li>
	<li id="rule5">A carbon atom HAD must have a bond-path of length 2 to at
	  least one heteroatom HAD</li>
	<li id="rule6">A heteroatom HAD must have a bond-path of even length to
	  at least one heteroatom HAD or a bond-path of length 2 to at
	  least one carbon atom HAD.
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      A bond-path is a path of alternating single and multiple bonds
      between a donor and an acceptor, or, with the exception of the
      donor, a path of sp2-hybridised atoms.  For these purposes, the
      kekule form of aromatic systems is used, rather than all bonds
      being an equivalent "aromatic" type.  This causes some
      difficulties as there is normally more than 1 kekule form for an
      aromatic system and all have to be allowed for.  The bond-path
      can include consecutive multiple bonds, such as in allenes -
      this is implied by the allowance for a path of sp2-hydridised atoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, see <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>.  In this
      compound, atoms 2, 4, 6, 7, 13 and 14 are HADs, in two different
      tautomeric systems.  Some of the bond-paths are 2-3-4, 6-5-4-3-2
      and 14-15-9-10-11-12-13.

    <h4>Refinements to HAD definitions</h4>
    <p>
      Extensive experiments with the algorithm
      using <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">Chembl</a> (v22)
      demonstrated a need to refine the HAD definitions.  Rule numbers
      here refer to the numbering of Thalheim et al., for consistency
      with annotation in the gen_t_skel code.  The number in brackets
      corresponds to the list above.
    </p>
    <h5>Relaxing <a href="#rule4">Rule 4(3)</a></h5>
    <p>
      Rule 4 says that a carbon atom cannot be in an aromatic ring.
      This is, to some extent, at the mercy of the aromatic model of
      the underlying cheminformatics toolkit used to implement the
      algorithm.  More of a problem was shown
      by <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL440484">CHEMBL440484</a>
      which contains a O=C1COC=C1 group, which can tautomerise to
      Oc1cocc1 (see <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>).  However, Rule 4
      forbids the return tautomerisation because the aromatic C atom
      (atom 2 in conventional numbering schemes) is deemed a
      non-HAD.  To solve this, in 5-membered aromatic systems (which
      must, in normal circumstances, be heteroaromatic) the 2 and 4
      carbon atoms can be HAD acceptors.
      <table id="figure4">
	<caption>Figure 4</caption>
	<tr>
	  <td><img src="CHEMBL440484.png"></td>
	  <td><img src="figure4_2.png"></td>
	  <td><img src="figure4_3.png"></td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <h5>Extending <a href="#rule5">Rule 5(4)</a></h5>
    <p>
      Rule 5 says that a carbon HAD must have a bond-path of length 2
      to at least 1 heteroatom HAD.  This has been extended to allow
      1,5 shifts in non-cyclic systems such as CC=CC=O, as shown in
      <a href="figure5">Figure 5</a>, so long as the carbon-carbon
      double bond is not labelled trans. In that case, the H on the
      end carbon and the carbonyl oxygen can't be brought close enough
      together to affect the shift.
      <table id="figure5">
	<caption>Figure 5</caption>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <img src="figure5_1.png">
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    <img src="figure5_2.png">
	  </td>
	</tr>
	</table>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also important that in the process we don't form a cyclic
      allene.  So, a carbon atom can't be a HAD donor if it has an
      unsaturated bond that's not in the bond-path.  In this case,
      that bond-path is removed and the donor flagged as not a HAD. 
    </p>
    <h5>Packer's N Rule</h5>
    <p>
      The Packer in this case is Martin Packer of AstraZeneca.  He
      suggested that it doesn't make sense to add an H atom to an
      aromatic nitrogen if theres another aromatic nitrogen in the
      ring, so as to avoid the situation shown
      in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>.  It needs to be a bit more
      nuanced than that to allow the shuffling of H atoms from N to N
      in a larger aromatic system, such as that in CHEMBL8387.
      <table id="figure6">
	<caption>Figure 6</caption>

	  <td><img src="figure6_1.png"></td>
	  <td><img src="figure6_2.png"></td>

	  <td><img src="CHEMBL8387b.png"></td>	  
	</tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <h5>Phenol Rule</h5>
    <p>
      Don't form the keto form of an phenol, unless it's a 2- or
      4-pyridol or similar.  One might think this is explicitly
      excluded by Rule 4, an aromatic carbon can't be a HAD, but the
      bond-path might exit the aromatic system to a more distant H
      atom acceptor, as in CHEMBL11575 shown
      in <a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>.  The second tautomer is
      removed by applying the phenol rule.
      <table id="figure7">

	  <td><img src="CHEMBL11575.png"></td>
	  <td><img src="CHEMBL11575_bad.png"></td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    
    <h5>Miscellaneous Tweaks</h5>
    <p>
      Some groups just don't belong in tautomer systems, including
      nitro and azido groups and simple acids and amides.  The latter
      are left in as an option.  Simple in this context means not in a
      large conjugated system. Also, 2-methyl pyridines are explicitly
      excluded from tautomerising. The rules allow for them to
      transform as shown in <a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a>
      <table id="figure8">
	<caption>Figure 8</caption>

	  <td><img src="figure8_1.png"></td>

    </p>

    <h3>Generating the tautomer skeleton</h3>
    <p>
      The tautomer skeleton is formed by
      removing an H from each donor HAD and subtracting 1 from the
      bond order of all multiple bonds in the bond-paths.  In a simple
      case this is all that is required to generate the tautomer
      skeleton. However, it is important that all possible tautomers
      of a molecule produce the same t_skel, and as can be seen
      in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, tautomers 1 and 2 will give
      different t_skels.  To this end, the set of tautomers derived
      from the HADs and bond-paths is generated (see below) and each
      of these is passed back into the algorithm.  This loop continues
      until no new tautomers are produced, at which point all the
      sub-t_skels are combined into a single global one.
