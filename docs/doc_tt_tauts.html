    <h2>A Tautomer-Independent Structure Representation</h2>
    <p>
      Tautomers represent a particularly thorny problem in
      cheminformatics.  There are several areas where they are of
      great relevance:
      <ol>
	<li>Getting the protonation and charge states correct for,
	  for example, virtual screening e.g. docking</li>
	<li>When attempting to find a structure in a database,
	  recognising two tautomers of the same molecule as
	  equivalent</li>
	<li>When performing substructure searching, recognising
	  potential tautomers in either the query or target
	  molecule</li>
      </ol>
      None of these are particularly well solved.  The first is
      arguably a physics problem, as the equilibria between the
      various tautomers depend on at least the solvent, the
      temperature and the pH.  In the case of ligand/receptor 
      interactions, it is more than likely that the equilibria are
      different in bulk solvent and in the receptor pocket, which
      further complicates modelling in the field of drug discovery.
      There are various rules-based and physics-based methods for
      estimating the possible tautomers when preparing ligand
      databases for virtual screening.  The second case is essentially
      a chemoinformatics problem.  It suffices merely to recognise all
      the tautomers that might be drawn for a molecule and
      represent them in some predictable way so that a query
      structure can be compared with a second structure and a
      tautomer-independent exact match determined.  The simplest,
      though inefficient, method of doing this is to enumerate all
      possible tautomers of the query and target structure and perform
      some form of graph isomorphism test.  Since there is no need to
      assess the tautomeric equilibria one can tolerate unlikely
      tautomers produced by relatively simple rules-based methods so
      long as false matches are minimised.  The last problem, of
      substructure searching, is the hardest.  Because the possible
      tautomers available to a molecule very much depend on the
      extended environment of functional groups, it is not in general
      possible to describe the tautomers available to an
      isolated substructure.  To perform a tautomer-aware substructure
      query, therefore, one is pretty-much obliged to enumerate all
      tautomers of the target molecules, either on the fly or on
      database creation, and match the substructure against each in
      turn.  This is likely to be expensive in CPU-time and/or
      database size.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work addresses the second of these problems, that of
      finding exact matches of the same molecule in different
      tautomers.  It is intended to be used primarily when adding a
      new molecule to a structural database, to see if it is already
      present.  It might also be used for the associated question of
      whether a compound should be synthesised, or whether it already
      exists in a database and can be obtained from store or
      purchased.  An example of the type of situation that this work is
      attempting to address is shown in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>
      below, for CHEMBL16405 and  CHEMBL417634.

      Clearly these two compounds are tautomers, and even if it is
      possible to isolate them as separate chemical samples, it would
      be helpful if the 
      database was able to link them as closely related structures.
      The representation in the 3rd column of the table above shows
      a tautomer-independent representation (the tautomer skeleton) of
      the two molecules, produced by the current work, that shows the
      tautomer system and allows them to be identified as possibly
      being two tautomers of the same compound.
    </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of this work, encapsulated in the program gen_t_skel, is
      to produce a representation of a compound where areas of
      tautomerism are identified, and marked in a <em>tautomer
      skeleton</em> or <em>t_skel</em>.  Before a compound is
      added to a database, as part of the procedure to see if it is a
      duplicate of a compound already present, its t_skel is created
      and compared with  those already in the database.  In the
      program gen_t_skel, the tautomer system is represented by
      setting all bonds to 1 and removing the hydrogen atoms that move
      during the tautomerisation.  The structure so produced is output
      as a canonical SMILES string in which the atoms in the tautomer
      system appear as atoms with unconventional valences. In the
      depiction in <a href="#figure1">Figure 1 above</a>, produced by
      <a href="https://docs.eyesopen.com/toolkits/cpp/depicttk/index.html">OpenEye's
      OEDepict  toolkit</a>, the unusual valence is shown by a 'dot'.
    </p>
    <p>
    The basis of the program gen_t_skel is
    the <a href="10.1002/minf.201400128">paper of Thalheim et al.</a>
    which describes a way of enumerating tautomers. The tautomer
    skeleton is an intermediate step in the enumeration process.
    Program gen_t_skel uses a refined version of their algorithm for
    finding the tautomer skeleton, and a similar method for generating
    tautomers.  Although the tautomers of the compound aren't kept or
    output by gen_t_skel, they are created during the process as
    larger tautomer systems are sometimes only discovered by an
    iterative  process.  For example, in <a href="#figure2">Figure
    2</a>, it is not  immediately obvious that Tautomer 2 is a
    tautomer of Tautomer 1, without inspecting the ketone form,
    Tautomer 3.

    <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
      Thalheim et al. introduced the concept of hydrogen acceptors and
      donors (HADs) as the key atoms in the tautomerisation process.  To
      convert one tautomer to another, a hydrogen atom is removed from
      a donor atom and added to an acceptor and the bonds adjusted to
      restore valences correctly.  There is clearly a potential
      confusion in this nomenclature with hydrogen <em>bond</em>
      donors and acceptors which are completely different.  Better
      names might have been source and sink or source and destination,
      but I have continued with their convention.
    </p>
    <p id="bond_path_defn">
      They also define a bond-path as a path of alternating
      single and multiple bonds 
      between a donor and an acceptor, or, with the exception of the
      donor, a path of sp2-hybridised atoms.  For these purposes, the
      kekule form of aromatic systems is used, rather than all bonds
      being an equivalent "aromatic" type.  This causes some
      difficulties as there is normally more than 1 kekule form for an
      aromatic system and all have to be allowed for.  The bond-path
      can include consecutive multiple bonds, such as in allenes -
      this is implied by the allowance for a path of sp2-hydridised atoms.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Identify the HADs</h3>
    <p id="thalheim_list">
      Thalheim et al. define HADs as follows:
      <ol>
	<li id="rule2"> A HAD has at least one double bond to a heavy atom or is
	  connected to an H atom (acceptor and donor respectively)</li>
	<li id="rule3">A HAD without an H atom (acceptor) must have a bond-path
	  to another HAD (donor) than can release an H atom</li>
	<li id="rule4">A carbon atom HAD must not be in an aromatic ring
	  system</li>
	<li id="rule5">A carbon atom HAD must have a bond-path of length 2 to at
	  least one heteroatom HAD</li>
	<li id="rule6">A heteroatom HAD must have a bond-path of even length to
	  at least one heteroatom HAD or a bond-path of length 2 to at
	  least one carbon atom HAD.
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, see <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>.  In this
      compound, atoms 2, 4, 6, 7, 13 and 14 are HADs, in two different
      tautomeric systems.  Some of the bond-paths are 2-3-4, 6-5-4-3-2
      and 14-15-9-10-11-12-13.

    <h4>Refinements to HAD definitions</h4>
    <p>
      Extensive experiments with the algorithm
      using <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl">Chembl</a> (v22)
      demonstrated a need to refine the HAD definitions.  Rule numbers
      here refer to the numbering of Thalheim et al., for consistency
      with annotation in the gen_t_skel code.  The number in brackets
      corresponds to the <a href="#thalheim_list">list above</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Relaxing <a href="#rule4">Rule 4(3)</a></h4>
    <p>
      Rule 4 says that a carbon atom HAD cannot be in an aromatic ring.
      This is, to some extent, at the mercy of the aromatic model of
      the underlying cheminformatics toolkit used to implement the
      algorithm.  More of a problem was shown
      by <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL440484">CHEMBL440484</a>
      which contains a O=C1COC=C1 group, which can tautomerise to
      Oc1cocc1 (see <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>).  However, Rule 4
      forbids the return tautomerisation because the aromatic C atom
      (atom 2 in conventional numbering schemes) is deemed a
      non-HAD.  To solve this, in 5-membered aromatic systems (which
      must, in normal circumstances, be heteroaromatic) the 2 and 4
      carbon atoms can be HAD acceptors.
      <table id="figure4">

	</tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <h4>Extending <a href="#rule5">Rule 5(4)</a></h4>
    <p>
      Rule 5 says that a carbon HAD must have a bond-path of length 2
      to at least 1 heteroatom HAD.  This has been extended to allow
      1,5 shifts in non-cyclic systems such as CC=CC=O, as shown in
      <a href="figure5">Figure 5</a>, so long as the carbon-carbon
      double bond is not labelled trans. In that case, the H on the
      end carbon and the carbonyl oxygen can't be brought close enough
      together to affect the shift.
      <table id="figure5">
	<caption>Figure 5</caption>
	<tr>
	  <td>
	    <img src="figure5_1.png">
	  </td>
	  <td>
	    <img src="figure5_2.png">
	  </td>
	</tr>
	</table>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also important that in the process we don't form a cyclic
      allene.  So, a carbon atom can't be a HAD donor if it has an
      unsaturated bond that's not in the bond-path.  In this case,
      that bond-path is removed and the donor flagged as not a HAD. 
    </p>
    <h4>Packer's N Rule</h4>
    <p>
      The Packer in this case is Martin Packer of AstraZeneca.  He
      suggested that it doesn't make sense to add an H atom to an
      aromatic nitrogen if there's another aromatic nitrogen in the
      ring, so as to avoid the situation shown
      in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>.  It needs to be a bit more
      nuanced than that to allow the shuffling of H atoms from N to N
      in a larger aromatic system, such as that in 
      <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL8387">CHEMBL8387</a>.

      </table>
    </p>

    <h4>Phenol Rule</h4>
    <p>
      Don't form the keto form of a phenol, unless it's a 2- or
      4-pyridol or similar.  One might think this is explicitly
      excluded by Rule 4, an aromatic carbon can't be a HAD, but the
      bond-path might exit the aromatic system to a more distant H
      atom acceptor, as
      in <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL11575">CHEMBL11575</a>
      shown
      in <a href="#figure7">Figure 7</a>.  The second tautomer is
      removed by applying the phenol rule.

    <h4>Miscellaneous Tweaks</h4>
    <p>
      Some groups just don't belong in tautomer systems, including
      nitro and azido groups and simple acids and amides.  It is
      certainly difficult to envisage a chemist drawing a structure
      such as that on the right of
      <a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a> rather than that on the left,
      without there being a good reason for which we should go with
      her judgement.

      The tautomerisation of
      amides are left in as an option, off by default.  Simple amides
      in this context means not in a
      larger conjugated system. Also, 2-methyl pyridines are explicitly
      excluded from tautomerising. The rules as described so far allow
      for them to transform as shown in <a href="#figure9">Figure
      9</a>.

    <h3>2. Identify the Bond Paths</h3>
    <p>
      Once the HADs have been identified, the bond paths are generated
      by finding all paths between all pairs of HADs that satisfy the
      requirements for a bond path, as described
      <a href="#bond_path_defn">above</a>.  Some of the HAD
      definitions depend on the bond paths that are found, so an
      iterative process is required until the HADs and bond paths are
      self-consistent.  For example, a carbon atom initially identified
      as a HAD might fail Rule 5 i.e. it must be in a bond path of
      length 2 to a heteroatom.  All bond paths ending with this atom
      are no longer valid so will be removed.  This might have the
      effect of removing all bond paths containing another HAD and, if
      so, that HAD must be removed from the list of HADs as it is no
      longer relevant.
      Since a bond path must have a donor atom at one end and an
      acceptor at the other, paths with a donor or acceptor at either
      end must also be removed.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Split the Molecule into Connect Sets</h3>
    <p>
      It is likely, as in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>, that there is
      more than one tautomer system in the molecule.  Thalheim et
      al. term these <em>connect sets</em> and they are defined as being
      contiguous sections of the molecule where there are bond paths
      between all HADs in the connect set. In Figure 3, the two connect
      sets are separated by the single bond between atoms 7 and
      8.  Each connect set can be dealt with independently of the others
      for the purposes of generating the t_skel, which makes the
      algorithm much more efficient in both memory and CPU time, since
      the combinations of tautomers in the different connect sets can be
      ignored.  One only needs to consider the connect sets collectively
      if one needs to generate all possible tautomers that the molecule
      can adopt.
    </p>
    
    <h3>4. Generate the Tautomer Skeleton</h3>
    <p>
      The tautomer skeleton is formed by
      removing an H from each donor HAD and subtracting 1 from the
      bond order of all multiple bonds in the bond-paths.  In a simple
      case this is all that is required to generate the tautomer
      skeleton. However, it is important that all possible tautomers
      of a molecule produce the same t_skel, and as can be seen
      in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>, tautomers 1 and 2 will give
      different t_skels.  To this end, the set of tautomers derived
      from the HADs and bond-paths is generated
      (<a href="#generate_taut_set">see below</a>) and each
      of these is passed back into the algorithm.  This loop continues
      until no new tautomers are produced, at which point all the
      sub-t_skels are combined into a single global one. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="generate_taut_set">5. Generate the Tautomer Set</h3>
    <p>
      In this phase, each connect set is considered separately.  Thus,
      the full set of tautomers, with all cross-combinations of
      tautomers between connect sets, is not generated.  This is to
      save time and memory as it prevents a potentially large
      combinatorial explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each bond path represents a possible tautomer pair of the parent
      molecule.  Generating the tautomers is therefore
      straightforward:
      <ol>
	<li>Take the next bond path for this connect set</li>
	<li>One end of the bond path is the hydrogen atom donor;
	  remove an H atom from it</li>
	<li>The other end of the bond path is the hydrogen atom
	  acceptor; add an H atom to it</li>
	<li>Reduce the bond order of the unsaturated bonds in the
	  bond path by 1</li>
	<li>Use a variant of Kearsley's
	  algorithm (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-8485(93)80022-6">S. Kearsley,
	  Computers. Chem., 17, 1-10 (1993)</a>)  to generate a new
	  unsaturation pattern that accommodates the transferred
	  hydrogen atom and the valences in the bond path</li>
	<li>If more bond paths to process, go to 1</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thalheim et al.'s original paper did the tautomer enumeration
      for a connect set in one go, by removing a hydrogen atom from
      all the donors, reducing the orders of all unsaturated bonds by
      1, and adding hydrogen atoms to acceptors in a combinatoric
      manner.  However, occasionally this resulted in tautomers that
      were not possible to create by single hydrogen atom moves and so
      are probably not physically relevant - it seems unlikely that
      two hydrogen atoms from the same conjugated system would be
      removed at the same time at physiological pH and temperature.  A
      consequence of this behaviour is that tautomers can be generated
      that when fed back into the algorithm as a fresh input structure
      don't reproduce the original
      (a <a href="#round_trip_problem">"round-trip failure"</a>, of
      which 
      more later).  The algorithm above, whilst probably less
      efficient in terms of time and memory, is simpler to implement
      and maintain and, more importantly, doesn't suffer from this
      issue. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In large highly conjugated molecules the number of tautomers
      generated can become very large, even when the connect sets are
      dealt with in isolation.  Because of this, there are time and
      tautomer-count cutoffs which cause early termination of the
      t_skel generation loop. If one of these is triggered, the global
      t_skel found so far is returned which is likely to be of some
      use even if it is not definitive.
    </p>
    <h3>6. Generate the Global Tautomer Skeleton</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of the iterative process detailed above, there will
      be one or more t_skels, from 1 or more tautomers.  These need to
      be combined into a single t_skel applied to the input
      tautomer. Each t_skel is described as a list of hydrogen atom
      donors, bonds whose order is to be decremented, and bonds whose
      order is to be incremented.  These are combined into a single
      set with each atom and bond being included only once. This is
      the raw t_skel description to be applied to the input
      structure to make the global t_skel.
      However, before this is done, some redundancy checks are
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, any non-aromatic bonds that are set to one and immediately back
      to double are removed from both lists as that's a pointless
      transformation that increases the size of the t_skel to no
      benefit.  Aromatic bonds are ignored because the particular kekule
      form used to represent an aromatic system as alternating single
      and double bonds is arbitrary.  During the t_skel generation
      process, some tautomers may have 1 kekule form, others may have
      another.  The pattern of single and double bonds in an individual
      t_skel may have come from a kekule form not seen in the input
      structure. It is therefore likely to be valid, and probably
      represents the propogation of a tautomer "the other way round
      the ring."
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, the mobile hydrogens are examined.  The merging
      process can sometimes result in <a href="#rule4">Rule 4(3)</a>
      being broken, such that aromatic carbon atoms are H atom
      donors. The likely cause of this is a tautomer breaking the
      aromaticity of a system. If this has happened, the H atom is
      removed from the t_skel.

    <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
    <p>
      In order to assist in the testing, three additional programs were
      written and are available in the download.
      One, <em>tt_tauts</em> is a Qt-based graphical program which
      reads an input file and for shows the input molecule, the t_skel
      and the tautomers, as seen in <a href="#figure10">Figure
	10</a>.  The slider down the left hand side controls which
      molecule is shown, so it allows rapid inspection of structures
      in a multi-molecule file.

      </table>
      At present, it's a read-only system, though perhaps that should be changed
      to enable it to output either the t_skels or the tautomer
      sets. The second program, <em>tt_tauts_batch</em> tests the
      "<a href='#round_trip_problem'>round-trip problem"</a>. The
      third, <em>test_tt_tauts</em> uses
      the <a href="https://github.com/philsquared/Catch">Catch</a>
      unit testing library for regression testing. It's important when
      making changes that previously working test cases continue to
      work. Program <em>test_tt_tauts</em> contains 95 SMILES
      strings, mostly of molecules that have caused problems during
      the development of the system, along with the expected result,
      and 15 structures for a round-trip test.  All of these should be
      run before accepting a new version of the t_skel generation
      algorithm.

    <h3>Sample Results</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="figure11">Figure 11</a> contains some examples of
      different tautomers and the t_skel the have in common, to give
      some idea of the types of structures covered by the
      algorithm. They are all either taken directly from Chembl v22.1
      or tautomers or substructures of a structure from there.

    <h3 id="round_trip_problem">The Round-Trip Problem</h3>
    <p>
      An obvious test of the program is that all tautomers of a
      molecule should produce the same t_skel. One convenient way of
      testing this is to take all tautomers generated from the input
      structure, and generate t_skels for them, a so-called
      round-trip test.  The program <em>tt_tauts_batch</em> does this for a
      multi-molecule input file.  Since it is intended for testing
      only, the output is not especially user-friendly. The crucial
      lines commence 'AWOOGA' and give the name of the molecule that
      failed the round-trip along with the number and SMILES string of
      the tautomer that didn't produce the t_skel, and the SMILES
      strings of the original and offending t_skels.
    </p>
    <p>
      A file of 19962 structures were extracted at random from a
      file of the 1678393 SMILES strings from Chembl v22.1 using the
      command
      <pre>
	awk '{if(rand() < 0.01185) print $0}' chembl_22_1.smi > chembl_22_1_rand_01185.smi
      </pre>
      The value 0.01185 was arrived at by trial and error to produce
      close to 20000 structures.  These were round-trip tested using
      the command
      <pre>
	./tt_tauts_batch --max-time 300 --max-tauts 2000 -I chembl_22_1_rand_01185.smi > chembl_22_1_rand_01185.out
      </pre>
      This specifies a timeout for individual t_skel generation of
      300s, and a maximum number of tautomers to be generated of
      2000. 
      
    </p>

    <h3 id="generating_t_skels">Generating T_Skels</h3>
    <p>
      Program <em>gen_t_skels</em> was run on the same file of 19962
      structures, using the command
      <pre>
	./gen_t_skel --max-time 300 --max-tauts 2000 --max-atoms 200 -I chembl_22_1_rand_01185.smi
      </pre>
      This has the same cutoffs as for the round-trip testing.
      Because of the limit on heavy atoms, 19922 t_skels were produced
      at an average time of 0.075s per molecule, with the worst case
      being <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL2013210">CHEMBL2013210</a>
      which took 152s.  There were no duplicate t_skels in this set.
